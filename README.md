# PROJECT README
## _Brief Description_

This project was made for the subject "Data Structures and Algorithms" at Universidad de Costa Rica. It consists in the implementation of several sort-algorithms and a report that analyzes how efficient they are, making several comparisons.

The sort-algorithms implemented are:

- selection sort
- insertion sort
- merge sort
- heap sort
- quick sort
- radix sort

`main.cpp` Test every sort-algorithm.

`Sort.cpp` Implementation of sort-algorithms.

*Note: some algorithms have auxiliary methods, this makes possible to test all algorithms by just passing as parameters the array and the size of it.*
